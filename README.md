## Project History

September 17, 2021
Tested under Windows and works well. Refactored some of the serial thread and made a "usable" display of the current bandpass. Release candidate for macOS.

July 20, 2021
Initial check in to github. Tesing has only been on macOS thus far. Connection, status display, and wingshift adjustments work. It is fully operational and useful, but still needs a nice graphical display of the current wavelength and wingshift adjustments.

July 15, 2021
Initial project creation. No code to check in as of yet until early prototpe is cleaned up.
